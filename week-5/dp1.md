Read until intermediate from the following [topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/) tutorial. Also solve all the related problems.

- Resources:
This week I'm following almost all the problems from 
[vplanet-coding](https://vplanetcoding.com/course2#698A)

Specifically, focus on problems:

- Extra notes: 

For problem G there is a solution that vplanet showed in her [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhi4mv-f6Ic) 
which has complexity  <MATH> O(n * n * m) </MATH>.

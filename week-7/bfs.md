So, we start moving into graph theory, here I'm going to follow exclusively [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/). 
There are going to be some problems that I consider are easier to solve with other graph theory topic (such as [this](
https://www.spoj.com/problems/MICEMAZE/) which is arguably easier to solve with Dijkstra or with Floydâ€“Warshall) and because of that I'm going to skip them.

Without further a due, the tutorials for this week are:
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/breadth-first-search.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/01_bfs.html

All the problems that I've solved are from those pages.

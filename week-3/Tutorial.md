This week we focused on binary search. We read the classic tutorial from [topcoder](https://web.archive.org/web/20180216130323/https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/).

The problems that I collected are from that tutorial and from [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/54526) CF entry.

For this week we focused on brute force. 

The main theory of this week is the idea that we have a search space (which are all the possibilities where the answer could be) and we
compute the time complexity of this solution. If it is not good enough we try to reduce that search space to a smaller one searching
certain properties of the problem (usually they are mathematical properties).

We also read how to make all the permutations of a set and all the subsets of a set in code. We use the cpHandbook (chapter 5).

The problems are the following:

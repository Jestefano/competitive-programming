This week we focused on binary search and merge sort, also we started to memorize some macros. 

We read the classic tutorial from [topcoder](https://web.archive.org/web/20180216130323/https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/). 

The problems that I collected are from that tutorial and from [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/54526) CF entry.

We also read [cp-handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf), chapters 1-2-3.

And we tried get used to some macros. For that we followed the following [topcoder tutorial](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/

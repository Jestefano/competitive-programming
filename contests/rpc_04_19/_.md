A) Implementation
B) Time-waster. Difficult to code (at least for me). I think that I need to code more problems like this to get use to it.
C) Find divisors in sqrt(V) and try every single possibility with the divisors (log(V)^3)
F) ...
G) The same strategy that was used in ACM ICPC Latin America (2017). I think it was problem B, it appears that it is an standard method.
J) There is a formula to solve this problem sqrt((s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)*(s-d))

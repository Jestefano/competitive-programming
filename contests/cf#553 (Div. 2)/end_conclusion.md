A) Implementation

B) The only way to change the value of zero of a XOR operation is by finding a different element (quite interesting observation tbh).
So we can check row by row.

C) 
Implementation, you have to advance by powers of two. Be careful with the mod!

D)
I have seen some problems related to two or three variables that can be thought as one variable, and with a simple modification
you can solve the general case. This is one of them. For more problems like this: Check Latinamerican Regional 2018, 517A-Div1,
and the problems of the bfs week.

After that simplification you have to do a exchange sorting proof (at least that's what I saw on the tutorial, for me it was
kinda obvious but I didn't know how to prove it). You can watch Algorithm live's video to understand it.

This week we focus on two main topics, recursion and backtracking. 

Since we assume that the student already has a mathematical background the idea of recursion is only implemented rather than explained.
Notice that we have already covered some examples of recursive functions (with mergesort and binary search).

- Read (or review) chapter 5 of cp-handbook (we are not covering sections 4 and 5 but it is interesting to read nevertheless).
- Read [programming challenges](http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf) chapter 8.

The problems are the following:
First, this require focusing on the effect of each position to the whole answer:

Then, we focus on recursion by itself:

Finally, about backtracking:

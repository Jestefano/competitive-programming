For this week we focused on basic structures: Queue, stack, deque, set and map (both hash and balanced binary search tree). 
We tried only simple problems.
The main objective was understanding the definition rather than solving tricky problems that involve this structures (this is going to be
the objective of next week).

Here are the problems:

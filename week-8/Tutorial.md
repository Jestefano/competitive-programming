So, this week we focus on DFS and some of its applications. The following are the resources:

- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/depth-first-search.html

- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bridge-searching.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/cutpoints.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/search-for-connected-components.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/finding-cycle.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bipartite-check.html
- https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/topological-sort.html
- Another way of doing (special) topological sort: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFpvX8T0-Pw&t=267s)

Don't get overwhelm by the amount of links, you can read all of it in less than 3-4 hours since they are not that long.

Extra note:
Even though there are only tree-edges and backward-edges in an undirected graph, once we run DFS sometimes we are going to evaluate whether a back-edge is a forward-edge. We need to be careful with that once we implement our algorithms.

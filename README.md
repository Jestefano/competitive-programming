# competitive-programming

Hello! 

So, here I am going to save (almost) all the resources that I've used to practice CP. I've done that with Vjudge and Google Drive until now but since I've been making some changes to the contests, I want to have a 'history' of the problems that I've solved with their respective solution.

After some solutions that I've uploaded, there is something important that I noticed. There are some cases where I don't follow the 'good practices', I do this for the sake of speed at coding. So don't panic if you see that there is a solution of mine that has almost a 100 lines, it could be the case that I just copied and pasted the same block of code in order to submit it as fast as possible.
